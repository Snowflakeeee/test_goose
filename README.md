# Project test_goose
Banderogus - the character of the russian propaganda, russians believe that it is a special military goose from the biolaboratory of Ukraine.<br>
At the same time, the mention of him support the positive spirit of the ukrainian people

During the project of GoIT, I tried several professions:
* Web designer
* Developer
* Project Manager
* QA engineer

So, about **web design**<br>
I created a site layout for my project. Learned more about working in Figma, acquired skills and learned the rules of interface development, and the correct design of the layout for transfer to typesetting. I also created pop-up windows and website footers. Figured out prototyping - made the model animated, in order to present it to the customer

**Development**
I mastered HTML and CSS for site layout, and also added a footer, created pop-up windows, made sure that the request from the site was sent to my mail, and also deployed (uploaded) the site to hosting

In the role of **Project Manager**, I got acquainted with the stages of the existence of an IT project, the Scrum project management methodology. I set goals and described the requirements for the product, added user stories to the Backlog and determined their priority too. 
<h3>Look to Spring Backlog.pdf

**QA** - At the final stage, I checked my project for errors and compliance with the technical assignment to verify that specific product requirements are met.
Filled out a checklist with these requirements and wrote bug reports.
